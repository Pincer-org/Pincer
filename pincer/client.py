    """
    Middleware are methods which can be registered with this decorator.
    These methods are invoked before any ``on_`` event.
    As the ``on_`` event is the final call.

    A default call exists for all events, but some might already be in
    use by the library.

    If you know what you are doing, you can override these default
    middleware methods by passing the override parameter.

    The method to which this decorator is registered must be a coroutine,
    and it must return a tuple with the following format:

    .. code-block:: python

        tuple(
            key for next middleware or final event [str],
            args for next middleware/event which will be passed as *args
                [list(Any)],
            kwargs for next middleware/event which will be passed as
                **kwargs [dict(Any)]
        )

    Two parameters are passed to the middleware. The first parameter is
    the current socket connection with and the second one is the payload
    parameter which is of type :class:`~.core.dispatch.GatewayDispatch`.
    This contains the response from the discord API.

    :Implementation example:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> @event_middleware("ready", override=True)
        >>> async def custom_ready(_, payload: GatewayDispatch):
        >>>     return "on_ready", [
        >>>         User.from_dict(payload.data.get("user"))
        >>>     ]

        >>> @Client.event
        >>> async def on_ready(bot: User):
        >>>     print(f"Signed in as {bot}")


    :param call:
        The call where the method should be registered.

    Keyword Arguments:

    :param override:
        Setting this to True will allow you to override existing
        middleware. Usage of this is discouraged, but can help you out
        of some situations.
